           Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model.
           React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose
           declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs
           for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router
           works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!
